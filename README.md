# CSE110: Programming Language I  
**Course Code:** CSE110  
**Course Title:** Programming Language I  
**Department:** Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), BRAC University  
**Offered:** [Your offering schedule, e.g., Spring 2025]  
**Pre-requisite:** N/A  

## Course Overview  
This course introduces foundational knowledge of programming concepts using **Java**, focusing on topics such as string manipulation, arrays, control structures, file input/output, and debugging techniques. Students will gain hands-on experience with programming tools, enabling them to write, debug, and execute programs while building proficiency in problem-solving and program design.

### Key Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Use flow control design tools to create flowcharts for problem-solving.
2. Write, debug, and execute programs using Java, applying control structures like branching and loops to solve problems.
3. Manipulate text data with string manipulation techniques.
4. Work with arrays to store, process, and sort data using various sorting techniques.
5. Use debugging and programming tools effectively.

## Course Objectives:
The objectives of this course are to:
- **a.** Develop an understanding of programming concepts and control structures.
- **b.** Demonstrate proficiency in using branching, looping structures, and conditional statements to solve problems.
- **c.** Apply string manipulation techniques and built-in functions to process text data.
- **d.** Use arrays to store and manipulate data and apply sorting algorithms.
- **e.** Gain hands-on experience with IDEs, debugging tools, and file I/O functions.
- **f.** Apply problem-solving skills and critical thinking to design solutions and develop working programs.
